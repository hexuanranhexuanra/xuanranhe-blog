## Why Recommend Them
**Grammarly** is an online grammar checker that can help you check for mistakes in your English writing and make it more suitable for practical use or business purposes. No matter how you write -- social media, email, Microsoft Word, etc. -- Grammarly provides a real-time check of the entire English writing process. Grammarly highlights checked spelling errors in red, and when the mouse hovers over the specified word or phrase, it can be corrected directly or read a detailed explanation of the error. The whole application is so user-friendly that it quickly dominates the lexical checking market.

**Google Classes** has a trackpad on the side (between the temple and the ear) that users can swipe to control a timeline-like user interface. Swipe back to show current events such as weather, and swipe forward to show historical events such as phone calls, photos, Google+ notifications, and more. A camera built into Google Glass can take photos or record 720p high-definition video.

These two videos explain how Grammarly and Glassglasses work and how to use them, which shows how novel and user-friendly they are.
