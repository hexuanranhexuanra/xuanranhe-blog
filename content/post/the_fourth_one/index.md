## Overview
This article shows the process of how gamification can make online surveys more interesting through specific cases. The article focuses on the reasons why online surveys are considered negative: speeding, random responses, lack of attention, etc. It also analyzes the benefits of gamification of surveys, focusing on user experience, user motivation, engagement, data volume, etc. This article documents the application of the entire process and the final gamification design, and qualitatively evaluates the importance of psychological and behavioral outcomes in gamification design.
## Unique Theme
In this article, To design a gamified online survey in this work, authors chose to follow the process which integrates and unifies the MDA (mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics) gamification framework and the three layers of form design, applying them to the various survey areas.
## How to evaluate gamification application
-  Game Elements for Inspiration. Prior to starting with the gamification process, designers should collect game elements that can inspire their further design activities.
- Aesthetics and the Relationship Layer. As a first step of the proposed process, designers should analyze the intended users (i.e., the surveyâ€™s target population), tasks(the form schema to be filled), and context, as described in the relationship layer of form design. 
- Dynamics and the Conversation Layer. Designers can use the MDA framework to reason about which game dynamics are suited for producing the intended aesthetics. 
- Mechanics and the Conversation and Appearance Layers. To produce the intended dynamics and aesthetics, designers can employ suitable game mechanics and playful elements. Again, they can use the catalogue of MDAs for inspiration.
## Comprehensive Conclusion
Gamification is a promising way of improving user experience and increasing engagement in online surveys. this work documents the successful application of a recently proposed design process for gamifying online surveys and describes the resulting design. The process was applied in a case study where two designers gamified a survey about sports and leisure activities amongst teenagers and young adults. The designers reported qualitative results supporting the practical usefulness and applicability of the process.
